Overview
This project aims to analyze aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to identify the safest aircraft and provide actionable insights that will guide the company’s acquisition strategy.
The analysis will focus on aviation accidents and incidents from 1962 to 2023, covering civil aviation in the United States. The investigation type taken into consideration is accidents. Key areas of investigation will include accident rates by aircraft type, common causes of accidents, and regional risk factors. The goal is to translate these findings into three concrete business recommendations that will help the head of the new aviation division make informed decisions on which aircraft to purchase.

Business Problem
Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

Stakeholders
The main stakeholder of this project is the Head of the Aviation Division.

Data
Two datasets were obtained for this project.
* A .csv file from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
* A .csv file with the United States names and their abbreviations

Data Sources
The data was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses)

Key Business Questions
* Which aircraft makes are associated with the fewest total injuries in recorded accidents?
* What are the most common causes of aviation accidents?
* Which regions  are associated with higher risks?

Visualizations

Key Findings
1. Based on the analysis, Air, Bellanca, Robinson, Grumman and  Mooney, aircraft makes show consistently lower injury rates compared to others

2. After reviewing the common causes and conditions associated with higher injury rates it’s clear that specific factors significantly increase the likelihood of accidents. For example, personal flights were observed to have higher injury rates followed by instructional flights. A majority of accidents occur under Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) rather than Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) or Unknown conditions. Non-Amateur built aircrafts had a higher number of injuries. This could suggest that these models are more widely used, leading to a greater number of incidents. It’s also possible that these aircraft are involved in more complex operations or environments that increase injury risks. 

3. The geographical analysis of injury severity highlights states where aviation-related accidents and injuries are more frequent. Certain areas show higher injury rates, potentially due to environmental conditions, air traffic, or regulatory differences.

Conclusions
1. Focus on Low-Injury Aircraft Makes: Our analysis of injury data has identified specific aircraft makes associated with lower total injury counts. By prioritizing these makes, your organization can potentially minimize safety risks and operational costs. This is particularly crucial as safety is a key factor in customer satisfaction and regulatory compliance.

2. Establish advanced training programs for pilots and any personnel affiliated to the aviation industry

3.Operate in regions with lower accident and injury rates. Avoid high-risk states, and prioritize markets where the probability of injury is lower. This can lower maintenance costs, increase safety compliance, and provide a smoother entry into the aviation market.
